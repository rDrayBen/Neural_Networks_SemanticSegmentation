# Neural_Networks_SemanticSegmentation

In this notebook we experimented with the different solutions for the semantic segmentation problem using dataset from kaggle(link provided in people_semantic_segmentation.ipynb file), which include custom built Unet model and pretrained Unet model from pytorch library. Models achieved 60% and 86% accuracy on IoU metric respectfully.
